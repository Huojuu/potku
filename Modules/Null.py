class Null:
    """A class for implementing Null objects.

    This class ignores all parameters passed when constructing or 
    calling instances and traps all attribute and method requests. 
    Instances of it always (and reliably) do 'nothing'.

    The code might benefit from implementing some further special 
    Python methods depending on the context in which its instances 
    are used. Especially when comparing and coercing Null objects
    the respective methods' implementation will depend very much
    on the environment and, hence, these special methods are not
    provided here.
