29.11.2016 - Potku version 1.1

Subscribe to the Potku-community email-list:
http://lists.jyu.fi/mailman/listinfo/potku


NOTES:
This version of Potku has been modified to include "awk.exe" file from the Gawk package "gawk-3.1.6-1-setup.exe" and the coinc.c accordingly
(previously one needed to add the awk.exe PATH to windows PATH's to get it working)

Also minor modifications (relates to different Python versions) have been done to the following files to show the legends correctly
in the potku such as in the depth-profile window:
'MatplotlibDepthProfileWidget.py', 'Functions.py', and 'Measurement.py'
ALSO note a change in POTKU: MatplotlibWidget.py line 33 “NavigationToolbar2QTAgg”. This script is no more offered from matplotlib since v1.5.0. I replaced it as “NavigationToolbar2QT”
The above modifications have been done by "Jinho" from KIST: <jinho1120@kist.re.kr>



INSTALLATION of POTKU 1.1 to WINDOWS 64bit (potku needs often memory more than 1.7GB(2Gbit))  for small files 32bit potku works ok, see below
There are many options, possibly to get this working but here are two methods

----------method 1, working on clean install windows 10, win 7, most likely also in win8--------
1. Install Anaconda3 (https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
2. Open command promt (start, type cmd)
3. In command promt, Create Python-virtual enviroment, where older versions of PyQT4, scipy and numpy are working properly with Potku: 
3.1 use following command:  conda create -n potku_pyqt4 pyqt=4.11.4 matplotlib scipy numpy
4. copy/unzip  Potku to some folder, like simple C:\potku

Running potku:
1. open command promt as above, and open the created virtual enviroment for python:
1.1 Use command:  activate potku_pyqt4
2. in the command promt/virtual enviroment: Go to the potku folder, eg. c:\potku\ and run potku using command:  python runpotku.py
3. Potku should now open with older version of python/qt4, some error (RGB..) might be listed but have no effect to actual software
4. NOTE: potku and anaconda might need to write in their installation folders (add rights if problems)

-------Method 2, should work also in clean installs of python to windows OS---
1. Download following file: Anaconda3-4.2.0-Windows-x86_64  (pyhton 3.5.2 version with 64bit installer
2. Install it normally with 64bit (include all)
3. To change the PYQT version type in command promt : conda install pyqt==4.11.4      so that ananconda changes the version of PYQT in use
4. To run potku, in commad promt, type "python runpotku.py"
5. NOTE: potku and anaconda might need to write in their installation folders (add rights if problems)






INSTALLATION of POTKU 1.0 to WINDOWS 32bit  (originally potku developed with python 3.3 some pyqt change is different from 1.1)
Two ways exits, A) full installation of python32bit, or B)a single packgage/zip file that has directly modified ro work without installation


--method A) for potku1.0 32bit window-- (python 3.4)

Download following packages and istall them in this order:
python-3.4.1.msi
pyhon-dateutil-2.2.win32-py3.4.exe (may not be needed)
numpy-MKL-1.8.1.win32-py3.4.exe
pytz-2014.4.win32-py3.4.exe (may not be needed)
pyparsing-2.0.2.win32-py3.4.exe (may not be needed)
matplotlib-1.3.1.win32-py3.4.exe
six-1.7.3.win32-py3.4.exe (may not be needed)
scipy-0.14.0.win32-py3.4.exe
PyQt4-4.10.4-gpl-Py3.4-QT4.8.6-x32.exe

(add Python install folder to windows PATH)
Copy potku and run normally from windows expolorer using python.exe  "runpotku.py"

--method B) for potku1.0 32bit window-- (python 3.4)
-
Download whole package provided in the
https://www.jyu.fi/fysiikka/en/research/accelerator/potku
which includes all the necessary files mentioned in the A) method, but does not require installation
Run potku using "runpotku.cmd"  -which "activates" the python.exe runpotku.py 
NOTE:here the gawk (awk.exe) is included in as whole packgage (slightly different version)
