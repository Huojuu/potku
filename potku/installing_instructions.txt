There are some external C programs which do the calculations needed for
the analysis. Those programs can be found from the directory

directories in potku/external.

There's a sh-file called compile_external in the potku folder.
Running it should install and compile the programs for Linux and Mac. 
Note that there must be a C compiler installed to the computer.


3. Installing and Running Potku
-------------------------------
 
1. If you haven't already downloaded the latest version of Potku,
   download it. You should receive the Potku in zip folder.
2. Unzip the folder and navigate to the folder in which the
   potku.py is. 
3. Run potku.py and the application should run. 
4. If there's an error (and nothing happens) run runPotku.py instead.
   This will append some folders in your PATH and the Potku should run.
5. After running runPotku.py once, you can start using the Potku.py.

After creating the first project, remember to configure proper
project settings! No settings are provided in the package.
