ABOUT genstop AND SRIM STOPPING DATA

These instructions assume Linux/OSX with SRIM installed under wine (at default
wine prefix) "C:\SRIM". Windows is not supported yet, sorry. Under Windows you
have to modify genstop.c or create a dummy program "wine".

See installation instructions below.

The genstop program will generate a binary file which includes the maximum Z
(default 113), number of velocity steps and the individual velocities for which
stopping was calculated.After that a table of stopping values for every Z1 in
every Z2 is tabulated for every individual velocity. The extract_stopping
program will load the stopping table to memory along with a table of
velocities.

Note that the default behaviour is to create a table for Z1=1...112,
Z2=1...112, v=(1/1000*0.05*c), ..., (0.05*c). Some of the higher Zs (Z >= 92)
are not computed. This is a (minor) limitation of SRIM. In order for the
stopping to be calculated there has to be at least one isotope with abundance >
0 for the element in masses.dat!

Velocities form an arithmetic sequence, but it is in the interest of the
developers to change this behaviour in the future. The binary data file must
therefore not be assumed to have equally spaced velocities! The program reading
the data can assume the file contains stopping for all elements with Z < Z_max.
The size of the actual stopping data can be determined from number of steps and
Z_max. Data is stored as doubles, whatever that means is up to your platform.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Compile

$ make


2. Install

$ make install


3. Copy binary from binary install directory to "SRIM/SR Module" directory

$ cp ../Potku-bin/genstop "~/.wine/drive_c/SRIM/SR Module/"
$ cd "~/.wine/drive_c/SRIM/SR Module/"


4. Run genstop

It is convinient to do this in the SR Module directory

$ ./genstop

Binary file "stopping.bin" should now have been written to Potku-data


5. Test data validity

Test for example by extracting stopping for helium in silicon (He Z=2, Si Z=14)
from 100 to 4000 keV every 10 keV.  First column is velocity in m/s, second is
the stopping in eV/(10^15 atoms).

assuming binary installation path is in your PATH

$ extract_stopping 4-He 28-Si 100 10 4000
