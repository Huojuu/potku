carbon_stopping

This program calculates stopping in a carbon foil (very special case)


Installation
-------------

make
make install
make carbon_stopping



Usage ------------

Give the carbon foil thickness as ug/cm^2 as an argument e.g.

./carbon_stopping 3.1

Give ions (element, isotope) and energy (in MeV) piped in from standard input
e.g.

echo -e "4-He 1.000\n16-O 4.5" |./carbon_stopping 3.1

The output will consist of beam proton number, nuclide number, energy, stopping
as eV/10^15 atoms at given energy, energy loss in foil of given thickness

So the last column should be the one of interest. Note that the energy loss in
the foil is still a positive number.
